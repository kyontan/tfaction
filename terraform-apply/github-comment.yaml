      Remote state was updated by #{{.Vars.pr_number}}, so this pull request's plan file became stale.
      Please rerun `terraform plan` to update a plan file, otherwise `terraform apply` would fail.
      For the detail, please see [Remote state was updated](https://suzuki-shunsuke.github.io/tfaction/docs/feature/auto-update-related-prs).
